# Indian Equity Value Investment Stock Analyzer (n8n)

**Indian-Equity-Investment-Stock-Analyzer** is an automated workflow, purpose-built for value investing in the Indian stock market, leveraging the n8n automation platform. This project focuses on robust, data-driven stock analysisâ€”grounded in fundamentals inspired by the "Deep Root" investment philosophyâ€”strictly excluding speculation in favor of proven, ethical, and evidence-based decision-making.
