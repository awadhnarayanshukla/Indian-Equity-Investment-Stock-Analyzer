# Indian Equity Value Investment Stock Analyzer (n8n)

**Indian-Equity-Investment-Stock-Analyzer** is an automated workflow, purpose-built for value investing in the Indian stock market, leveraging the n8n automation platform. This project focuses on robust, data-driven stock analysis—grounded in fundamentals inspired by the "principles of Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher, Peter Lynch, Mohnish Pabrai, and Joel Greenblatt." investment philosophy—strictly excluding speculation in favor of proven, ethical, and evidence-based decision-making.

## Project Overview

This workflow fetches live stock data from NSE, processes multiple key value indicators, and uses an OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo agent to deliver insightful, readable investment analysis. Every step is recorded and displayed with transparent logs, execution metrics, and clear AI output—making sophisticated analysis accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

### Complete Workflow Architecture

*Figure 1: Complete n8n workflow showing all nodes and their connections for Indian stock analysis*

- **Trigger & Automate:** Start the workflow with a simple chat command (e.g., "Analyze RELIANCE stock").
- **Data Collection:** Instantly pulls latest data from NSE.
- **Fundamental Logic:** Applies value investing models (not speculation) inspired by "Deep Root."
- **AI-Powered:** OpenAI agent (GPT-4 Turbo) interprets data and provides plain-English summary, transparent logs, and run metrics.

## Key Features

- **Automation:** End-to-end analysis powered by n8n workflow nodes for data, logic, and summaries.
- **Live Market Data:** Always operates on up-to-date NSE information.
- **Ethical Value Investing:** No guesswork, only fundamental indicators.
- **User-friendly Results:** Actionable insights, no jargon, full transparency.
- **Stepwise Clarity:** Visualization of setup, in-progress execution, and results (see screenshots).
- **Learning Showcase:** Transparent workflow logs, execution time, and token usage.

## Learning & Aspiration

This project represents my commitment to ethics, transparent workflow automation, and powerful, readable analytics as I pursue a career in data analysis. By blending automation, value principles, and AI, I'm focused on helping users—and future employers—access reliable, actionable market insights for confident investing.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Trigger Node - Chat Message Received

![Trigger Node](screenshots/01_trigger_node.jpg)

*Figure 2: Chat trigger configuration for receiving user stock analysis requests*

The workflow begins when a user sends a chat message with a stock symbol (e.g., "RELIANCE" or "TCS").

### 2. Workflow Configuration
